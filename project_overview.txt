Project Overview:
Define the Problem:

Clearly articulate the problem you're addressing, such as optimizing delivery routes, predicting delivery times, or improving overall logistics efficiency:

Creating delivery routes, predict delivery times (improving logistics), (this created df has the neccesarry info but depends on the API to generate the location, and to simulate the gps on the way)


Data Collection and Cleaning:

Create a dataset that represents the key variables of the problem, such as delivery locations, distances, delivery times, traffic conditions, etc.
Ensure the data is clean and well-organized.


Integration with Google Maps API for the creation of the fake data set:
When creating the data Im using the googleways library for creating the data by creating the longitud and latitude and then using the API for the location


Once the data es created we can continue to the "Real" parts such as EDA and Modeling but, treating this as the fake data set lets keep the EDA simple


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct EDA to understand the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and explore relationships between variables.
Create visualizations to illustrate key insights.



Predictive Modeling:

Use regression models or machine learning algorithms to predict important outcomes, such as delivery times or optimal routes.
Evaluate and compare the performance of different models.




Integration with Google Maps API:

Use the Google Maps API to enhance your analysis.
Fetch real-time or simulated data for routes, distances, and estimated times.




Dashboard Development:

Build an interactive dashboard using a tool like Shiny in R.
Include visualizations that provide an overview of the delivery system's performance.
Allow users to interact with the dashboard to explore different scenarios.
Simulated Real-Time Tracking:

Simulate real-time tracking by periodically updating the dashboard with new data.
Display estimated delivery times and current locations.

Documentation:

Create clear and concise documentation for the project, including explanations of your approach, key findings, and how to interact with the dashboard.



Presentation:

Develop a presentation that summarizes your project.
Highlight the problem, your approach, key insights, and the impact of your work.

Additional Considerations:

Scalability: Consider how your solution would scale for a large-scale operation like Coca-Cola. Discuss potential challenges and solutions.

Cost Analysis: If I am using external APIs like Google Maps, make a cost analysis for potential usage.

Security: If the project involves sensitive data, discuss the security measures implemented to protect the information.

Remember to tailor the project to your specific skills and interests, and be ready to explain your thought process and decision-making during potential interviews or discussions about your portfolio. Good luck with your project!
